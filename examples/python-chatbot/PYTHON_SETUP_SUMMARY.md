# Python Setup Issue Summary

## The Problem

Your Windows PATH has **Inkscape's Python** before your system Python:

```
Current PATH order:
1. C:\Program Files\Inkscape\bin\python.exe  ❌
   - This is Inkscape's bundled Python
   - No pip installed
   - No packages available

2. C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe  ✅
   - Your actual Python installation
   - Has pip and all packages
```

When you run `python`, Windows finds Inkscape's Python first, which is why packages aren't found.

## Why We Created Workarounds

We created these helper scripts because of the PATH issue:

- `run_chatbot.py` - Finds correct Python and runs chatbot
- `find_python.py` - Helps identify which Python has packages
- `install_deps.py` - Installs packages using correct Python

## Solutions (Choose One)

### ✅ Solution 1: Use Python Launcher (Easiest - No PATH Changes)

Windows has a Python launcher (`py`) that's smarter:

```bash
# Just use py instead of python
py -3.11 chatbot.py

# Or use the batch file
run.bat
```

**Pros:** Works immediately, no configuration needed  
**Cons:** Need to remember to use `py` instead of `python`

### ✅ Solution 2: Fix PATH (Best Long-term)

Remove or reorder Inkscape in your PATH. See [FIX_PYTHON_PATH.md](FIX_PYTHON_PATH.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Pros:** `python` command works normally after fix  
**Cons:** Requires editing system environment variables

### ✅ Solution 3: Keep Using Helper Scripts

Continue using `run_chatbot.py` - it works fine!

```bash
python run_chatbot.py
```

**Pros:** No changes needed  
**Cons:** Extra step, not as straightforward

## Recommended Action

**For immediate use:** Use `py -3.11 chatbot.py` or `run.bat`

**For permanent fix:** Follow [FIX_PYTHON_PATH.md](FIX_PYTHON_PATH.md) to fix your PATH

## Verification

After applying a solution, verify it works:

```bash
# Check Python version
py -3.11 --version
# Should show: Python 3.11.x

# Check if packages are available
py -3.11 -m pip show translation-helps-mcp-client
# Should show package info

# Test the chatbot
py -3.11 chatbot.py
# Should start the chatbot
```
